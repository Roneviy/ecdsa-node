This project is a simple web application for managing an Ethereum wallet. Users can input their private key, and the application automatically computes the corresponding wallet address. Then, the application checks the balance of this address using an external server and displays the current wallet balance in ETH.

Features:

Input private key to access the wallet.
Automatically compute the wallet address from the private key.
Check and display the wallet balance in ETH.
Utilizes Ethereum cryptography libraries for key derivation and address computation.
Implements communication with an external server to retrieve wallet balance information.
This project serves as a basic demonstration of Ethereum wallet management within a web application environment.
